# Deep Learning - Assignments
This repository consists of both Python and Tensorflow scripts implementing : 

## 1 : Backpropagation :
Implementation of a neural network in python, with tunable number of layers and number of neurons in each layer along with hyper parameters such as 
       Activation : sigmoid, tanh
       Loss       : Cross Entropy, Squared Error
       Optimiser  : Adam, GD, Momentum, NAG
       Anneal     : True, Falses                                                     ; specified as runtime arguements
       
## 2 : CNN :
Implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network using Tensorflow (used to train Fashion MNIST Dataset)
      
## 3 : Word Embeddings :
Scaped data from over 30 websites to successfully construct a corpus of nearly 15 million words in Malayalam Language. A comparitive study was conducted on the performance of existing word2vec models on this corpus and developed evaluation metrics and test cases were tested.

## 4 : seq2seq (Weather data summariser):
Implementation of Encoder-Decoder based model for table summarisation with and without Attention mechanism using uni-directional and bi-directional LSTM cells on Weather Gov Dataset.
      
## 5 : RBM and Gibbs Sampling :
Implementaion of Restricted Boltzmann machine and Gibbs sampling using python. The dataset utilised is yet again Fashion MNIST.
      
For RBMs, T-SNE plots have been depicted for the data for various values of learning rates and dimension of hidden representation.The effects of varying k on the Gibbs chain has also been demonstrated along with plots of samples generated by the Gibbs Chain.
      
For Gibbs sampling, convergence to true distribution was achieved even after starting from a random point.
