# DL-Assignments
This repository consists of both Python as well as Tensorflow scripts implementing : 

## 1 : Backpropagation :
       Implementation of a neural network in python, with tunable number of layers and number of neurons in each layer along with hyper parameters such as 
       Activation : sigmoid, tanh
       Loss       : Cross Entropy, Squared Error
       Optimiser  : Adam, GD, Momentum, NAG
       Anneal     : True, Falses                                                     ; specified as runtime arguements
       
## 2 : CNN :
      Implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network using Tensorflow (used to train Fashion MNIST Dataset)

## 4 : seq2seq :
		Implementation of Encoder-Decoder based model with and without Attention mechanism using uni-directional and bi-directional LSTM cells on Weather Gov Dataset.
      
## 5 : RBM and Gibbs Sampling :
      Implementaion of Restricted Boltzmann machine and Gibbs sampling using python. The dataset utilised is yet again Fashion MNIST.
      
      For RBMs, T-SNE plots have been depicted for the data for various values of learning rates and dimension of hidden representation.The effects of varying k on the Gibbs chain has also been demonstrated along with plots of samples generated by the Gibbs Chain.
      
      For Gibbs sampling, convergence to true distribution was achieved even after starting from a random point.
